ertorrent
=========

An emacs lisp interface to the rtorrent via xml-rpc.

Sick of the clunkiness of the rtorrent CLI interface and the rtgui web interface? This library gives you the chance to be sick of an emacs interface to rtorrent.

For example, the code is currently extremely incomplete and buggy, while it may throw up a tabulated list of torrents, no actions are supported on this list.
